&lt;p>Let me start with a disclaimer, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if this is a pattern that
must be followed or it&amp;rsquo;s just a weird idea coming out of my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that
thought about this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most
important disadvantage is the &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; way of checking the error just after the
line that can raise it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve experimenting a little bit with it and I found this solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Basically, with the default approach you would need 2 new lines as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>if err != nil {
...
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I find this pattern pretty useful for things like http handlers or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you are able to add a &lt;code>switch&lt;/code> at the end to check the kind of error and
keep your code more &amp;ldquo;organized&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you think? Should I use it in every place I can? Do you do it in a
better way?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
