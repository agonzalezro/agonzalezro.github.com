&lt;p>I am really proud of say that the next month I will be giving a talk at
PyGrunn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a really good new for me because PyGrunn is the conference that
my old colleagues organize since years ago. I was on it first time in
2011 just one week after I started working at
&lt;a href="http://paylogic.com">Paylogic&lt;/a>. I meet a lot of interesting people
there and I will see them again this year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2012 I repeat, but at that time I had already started to organize the
&amp;ldquo;Monthly PyGrunn&amp;quot;s with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/_ivor">Ivor&lt;/a>. TBH that talks
were quite successful, and not for the quantity of people that we get
there, if not for the quality of them and the networking after!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am really happy too because going there I will be able to see a lot of
friends that I miss! I just moved here 5 months ago but I really want to
see them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the less important thing: about the talk! I will be talking about
Thrift and how can we use it to talk between different applications in
different languages (in the examples: Python &amp;amp; Scala). When PyGrunn
finish I think that I will have a video where you can see the talk (or
check my English) and I will upload the slides too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.pygrunn.org">PyGrunn&lt;/a> for give me this chance!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
