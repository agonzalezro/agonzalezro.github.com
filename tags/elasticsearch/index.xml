&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat">packetbeat&lt;/a> is one of the best
application performance management tools in the opensource community. It&amp;rsquo;s now
part of the &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats">beats&lt;/a> that Elastic provide
us to monitor our applications. What it does is analyze our data packets to
send some useful information to ElasticSearch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the introduction you probably realize that we will need: ElasticSearch
installed and if you want to see something useful you will need Kibana as well.
There is a &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-getting-started.html">guide for getting
started&lt;/a>
that explains the process pretty clearly. The &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; with that guide is that
you need to install everything in your machine, this blog post is a 101 to have
it quickly running into containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As mentioned, we will need ES and Kibana:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 --name elasticsearch-pb elasticsearch
docker run -d -p 5601:5601 --name kibana-pb --link elasticsearch-pb:elasticsearch \
-e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200 kibana
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now we have all the required things to run our packetbeat. There are few points
that I want to raise before doing so:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>packetbeat will be monitoring our network traffic, this means that our
container running packetbeat needs to have access to the host network.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the last &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> I found regarding this was:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-docker">https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-docker&lt;/a> by
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tudor_g">Tudor&lt;/a> (one of the original developers) but
it is a little bit old. So I made my own based on that (should PR but I
wonder why the previous was not updated yet, and it would be nice to run
something more actual than 0.5 but there are no binaries):&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The previous docker image will require a file &lt;code>packetbeat.yml&lt;/code> to work after.
As a quick start you can use this one:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat/blob/master/packetbeat.dev.yml">https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat/blob/master/packetbeat.dev.yml&lt;/a> but
probably you would like to change your device from &lt;code>en0&lt;/code> to &lt;code>docker0&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker build -t agonzalezro/packetbeat .
docker run --net=host agonzalezro/packetbeat
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Cool, now you are ready to go! Everything that you do into your containers will
be show on Kibana, to test it go to you docker host port &lt;code>5601&lt;/code>, it will ask
for an index pattern, change the default &lt;code>logstash-*&lt;/code> to &lt;code>packetbeat-*&lt;/code> and
enjoy it!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you have any comment, let me know here or in
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/agonzalezro">twitter&lt;/a>. Also, if you are interested in
monitoring with packetbeat you should definitely take a look to &lt;a href="http://acalustra.com/how-can-i-monitor-my-voip-application.html">&amp;ldquo;Kamailio
monitoring with statsd, SIPCapture or
Packetbeat&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>
by my friend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/eloycoto">eloycoto&lt;/a> who introduced me to
packetbeat :a)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
