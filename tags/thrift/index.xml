&lt;p>This was my talk on the &lt;a href="http://pygrunn.nl">PyGrunn&lt;/a> conference last
Friday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was explaining how can you communicate services written in different
languages using &lt;a href="http://thrift.apache.org/">Apache Thrift&lt;/a> for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In few days the videos will be available, but TBH, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know
if I will publish it here. It was not the first time that I talk in
public using English, but it will be the first time that it is
recorded&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if I want to see that! :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really need to improve my speed talking for the next time. I thought
that I will not have enough time to explain all, so, my subconscious
decided that I should be talking as a machine gun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, you will find the slides, if not, &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/python-and-scala-smoke-the-peace-pipe">try this
