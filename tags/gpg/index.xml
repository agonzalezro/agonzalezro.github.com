&lt;p>As you may know, yesterday, &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification">GitHub has presented a way to verify your commits&lt;/a> on their platform. This is not something new, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the git protocol, but now, they will show a fancy &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; label everytime you push a signed commit. Cool? Yeah, pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the problems I always had since I know GPG is to keep my keys locally. I am pretty sure that some other people take care of their keys as if they were part of their family, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that need yet. &lt;a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase&lt;/a> partially solved this problem for me, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it did it for you as well (ask me for an invite if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I want to start this article with a disclaimer, I am not a security professional or anything even closer to it; so, if you think I am saying anything stupid, please, do let me know. Also, if you are a heavy user of Keybase, take my steps carefully because I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you account will continue being usable by Keybase (I would expect so, but a disclaimer is always good).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What do we need to do then?&lt;/strong> Imagine that you are myself and you don&amp;rsquo;t have &lt;code>keybase&lt;/code> installed yet, also, you have a Mac:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>brew install keybase
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now go to your Keybase account and download the public and private key, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it, follow &lt;a href="http://www.keybits.net/2016/02/import-keybase-private-key/">this tutorial by Tom Atkins&lt;/a>. Summarising it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Go to your Keybase account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on your key fingerprint and copy/paste that on a file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on &amp;ldquo;edit&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;export my private key&amp;rdquo; and copy/paste that as well in a different file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now, &lt;code>gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import keybase-private.key&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And, &lt;code>gpg --import keybase-public.key&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You are good to go now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem that you will face trying to use your Keybase account is that your email address will look something like &lt;code>username@keybase.io&lt;/code> and you can not verify that account on github. For that reasonwe will need to update our key for adding your normal account email and delete the keybase one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, let&amp;rsquo;s add your normal account:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>What we did there on the first line was select the account &lt;code>keybase.io&lt;/code>, please, check the number associated with your &lt;code>keybase.io&lt;/code> account, don&amp;rsquo;t press &lt;code>1&lt;/code> just for the sake of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have everything you need now, so you just need to export your key and &lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">import it on github&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>gpg --armor --export agonzalezro@gmail.com
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>PS: &lt;code>pbcopy&lt;/code> is your friend here if you are using Mac :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing you need to do now is sign a commit, do that with &lt;code>git commit -S&lt;/code> and after pushing you will have this beautiful &amp;ldquo;label&amp;rdquo; close to your commit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I hope that you enjoyed the tutorial, let me know on the comments or on twitter (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agonzalezro">@agonzalezro&lt;/a>) if something I do is stupid or if you have found it useful!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
