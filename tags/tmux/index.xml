&lt;p>I had a system that was creating a different log for each worker. Those logs
where in the form: &lt;code>/var/log/baselog&lt;/code>, &lt;code>/var/log/baselog.1&lt;/code>,
&lt;code>/var/log/baselog.2&lt;/code> and so on. I wanted to tail them but they were being
updated simultaneously so the output of the tail was being a mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a &lt;a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux&lt;/a> user since few months ago (if you
aren&amp;rsquo;t, you should!) so I&amp;rsquo;ve decide to open all of them in different tmux
panes. Thanks to having a pane for every log what we will achieve is the
ability to scroll just one of them, maximize it in case that we need it, move
to a new window, save the buffer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can you achieve that? Quite simple, just download this script to some
place:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Once you have saved it installed, run it with the base log file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sh tail_several_logs.sh /var/log/baselog
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The script have some limitations easily fixable:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You should provide a fullpath.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The logs should be in the form of baselog.N where N is a number.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am pretty sure that the loop can be done better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And select the layout in every iteration is not the best of the ideas, but it
works.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Feel free of do whatever you want with the script. I just hope that it&amp;rsquo;s useful
for somebody else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
