      <p>I&rsquo;ve added a small but useful functionality to the <a href="http://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">polo static site
generator</a> that I am using here. Now, after
you generate your content from your files, you are going to be able to run a
small http server to see the content easily.</p>

    <title>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</title>

      <p>As some of you already know I work at <a href="http://greenmangaming.com">Green Man
Gaming</a> (mainly at the
<a href="http://playfire.com">playfire</a> project). We were planning to do some changes
in our architecture but it&rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services
and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper. I was trying, trust me, but it was
impossible.</p>

    <title>How to find a flat in London with some help</title>
    <link href="http://agonzalezro.github.io/how-to-find-a-flat-in-london-with-some-help.html" />
    
    <updated>2014-08-03 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</updated>
    
    <summary>
      <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I&rsquo;ve added a little bit more of code to the gist to get the latitude
and longitude of the flat. This way the process of plotting them is more
accurate and incredibly easy. Thanks again <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>!</p>

      <p>If you have seen my blog before I am pretty sure that you remember that the
current theme is not the one that it used to be. I&rsquo;ve created a theming
&ldquo;engine&rdquo; for <a href="https://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">polo</a> and for doing the
showcase of the functionality I&rsquo;ve chosen the awesome
<a href="https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386">BOOTSTRAP/386</a> theme.</p>

    <title>Tailing multiple logs with tmux</title>

    <updated>2014-03-15 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</updated>
    
    <summary>
      <p>I had a system that was creating a different log for each worker. Those logs
where in the form: <code>/var/log/baselog</code>, <code>/var/log/baselog.1</code>,
<code>/var/log/baselog.2</code> and so on. I wanted to tail them but they were being
updated simultaneously so the output of the tail was being a mess.</p>

      <p>After a really, really long time I am finally updating my old blog. Time ago I
tried to update it but I&rsquo;ve realised that a lot of JS of the site was
completely broken &amp; instead spend some time fixing it I&rsquo;ve decided to start it
from scratch with <strong>my own blog site generator written in Golang:
<a href="http://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">Polo</a></strong>.</p>

      <p>One of the problems that I always have when I start trying to blog
something is that I get bored very quick of writing and I focus in other
things like CMS, CSS or this kind of things that really doesn&rsquo;t matter
if you have good content.</p>
