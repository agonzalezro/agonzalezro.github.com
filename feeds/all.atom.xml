      <p>After a really, really long time I am finally updating my old blog. Time ago I
tried to update it but I&rsquo;ve realised that a lot of JS of the site was
completely broken &amp; instead spend some time fixing it I&rsquo;ve decided to start it
from scratch with <strong>my own blog site generator written in Golang:

    <title>Best vim colors ever!</title>

      <p>Sometimes a developer needs a change, and what can you change better
that the color scheme that you use to develop? You are more than 8h per
day in front of your vim with some beautiful, or crappy, code in front
of you. In the first case the colors doesn&rsquo;t matter, but in the second
it&rsquo;s really important to enjoy, at least, the colors!</p>

two weeks using it I can say that I&rsquo;m starting to hate it. In this new
version it has a lot of functions that I don&rsquo;t like and doesn&rsquo;t have a
lot of functions that I like :)</p>
