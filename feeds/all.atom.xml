      <p>Finally last weekend I did the CKA exam, I was procrastinating it a bit in part because I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect since Kubernetes is huge and I thought that each day extra I spend reading about it would help me.</p>

      <p>If you know me you probably know that I am always complaining that I want to start some pet project that could give me some kind of income.
The income is a nice incentive, but not for the income itself if not because it would be really nice to have somebody paying for a project that you started from scratch.</p>

    <title>How to read a Reader twice</title>

      <p>Some time ago I read about <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#TeeReader"><code>TeeReader</code></a> but to be fair, I didn&rsquo;t give it that much thought. However, few month back I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5ufcpTGIJM&amp;list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ">a video</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/francesc">@francesc</a> and his nice use case and I wrote down a new item in my mental TODO list about things I wanted to use.</p>

    <title>Change your phone DPIs without root</title>

      <p>I know that this post doesn&rsquo;t match that much with the typical posts I write here, but it seems needed! Every time I searched how to change the DPIs on my Android phone I was referred to root apps. I don&rsquo;t have my phone rooted (too much hassle) so I prefer not to do it just for this.</p>

      <p>One of the things I like the most about Go is its <code>go fmt</code> tool. I don&rsquo;t worry about formatting my code while I am writing it because I know that <code>fmt</code> is going to be there and it will do the work for me later.</p>

    <title>Key bindings for Spacemacs</title>

      <p>I am a happy user of <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> since few months ago. I was (and I still am) a vim user but Spacemacs provide you extremely good defaults and the installation of layers isn&rsquo;t painful at all, things that I sadly can&rsquo;t say about vim.</p>

      <p>As you may know, yesterday, <a href="https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification">GitHub has presented a way to verify your commits</a> on their platform. This is not something new, it&rsquo;s part of the git protocol, but now, they will show a fancy &ldquo;verified&rdquo; label everytime you push a signed commit. Cool? Yeah, pretty cool.</p>
