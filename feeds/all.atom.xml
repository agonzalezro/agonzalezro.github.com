that, if you use any other way I would be happy to hear it on the comments.</p>

network site in the style of the old-digg (with karma and this kind of things).</p>

      <p>Let me start with a disclaimer, I don&rsquo;t really know if this is a pattern that
must be followed or it&rsquo;s just a weird idea coming out of my head.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve added a small but useful functionality to the <a href="http://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">polo static site
generator</a> that I am using here. Now, after
you generate your content from your files, you are going to be able to run a
small http server to see the content easily.</p>

      <p>As some of you already know I work at <a href="http://greenmangaming.com">Green Man
Gaming</a> (mainly at the
<a href="http://playfire.com">playfire</a> project). We were planning to do some changes
in our architecture but it&rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services
and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper. I was trying, trust me, but it was
impossible.</p>

    <title>How to find a flat in London with some help</title>

    <updated>2014-08-03 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</updated>
    
    <summary>
      <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I&rsquo;ve added a little bit more of code to the gist to get the latitude
and longitude of the flat. This way the process of plotting them is more
accurate and incredibly easy. Thanks again <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>!</p>

      <p>If you have seen my blog before I am pretty sure that you remember that the
current theme is not the one that it used to be. I&rsquo;ve created a theming
&ldquo;engine&rdquo; for <a href="https://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">polo</a> and for doing the
showcase of the functionality I&rsquo;ve chosen the awesome
<a href="https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386">BOOTSTRAP/386</a> theme.</p>

    <title>Tailing multiple logs with tmux</title>

    <summary>
      <p>I had a system that was creating a different log for each worker. Those logs
where in the form: <code>/var/log/baselog</code>, <code>/var/log/baselog.1</code>,
<code>/var/log/baselog.2</code> and so on. I wanted to tail them but they were being
updated simultaneously so the output of the tail was being a mess.</p>

      <p>After a really, really long time I am finally updating my old blog. Time ago I
tried to update it but I&rsquo;ve realised that a lot of JS of the site was
completely broken &amp; instead spend some time fixing it I&rsquo;ve decided to start it
from scratch with <strong>my own blog site generator written in Golang:
<a href="http://github.com/agonzalezro/polo">Polo</a></strong>.</p>
