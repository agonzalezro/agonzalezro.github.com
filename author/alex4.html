    <p>First of all, I'm GNOME user as main desktop on Linux since the version
1.x (about 10 years ago). I've played with another desktops but GNOME
was always in my heart. But now, with the arrival of GNOME 3 and after
two weeks using it I can say that I'm starting to hate it. In this new
version it has a lot of functions that I don't like and doesn't have a
lot of functions that I like :)</p>
<p>After see my arguments, perhaps you can help me to change my opinion but
possibily my next post will treat about how erase GNOME 3 and go back to
Unity. Go to see them:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="static/fuuuu.jpg"><img alt="static/fuuuu.jpg" class="align-center" src="static/fuuuu.jpg" style="width: 50%;" /></a>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-virtual-desktops">
<h2>Dynamic virtual desktops</h2>
<p>I've always used virtual desktops. One for terminals, antoher for
explorers, another for music and a extra one for all other stuff. When I
want to go to my explorer I push Alt+2 and change my virtual desktop to
2. But now, I can't do it, because if I want to open the explorers in
the desktop 2 I must open something in the desktop one, but I don't like
it!</p>
<p>This is a very big problem for me because I'm not accustomed to use
Alt-Tab to change the windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-you-close-the-las-window-in-a-desktop">
<h2>When you close the las window in a desktop...</h2>
<p>the gnome-shell will be open! I don't like it! Perhpas I've closed this
window to go to my home folder, let me do that!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alt-f2-doesn-t-autocomplete">
<h2>Alt+F2 doesn't autocomplete</h2>
<p>GNOME always had this option instead KDE that didn't have it, and now,
they erase it? I can't understand why! I know that you can use the Super
key (the fuc***g windows key presented on all keyboards), but use the
gnome-shell to open a program isn't so quickly as open it with alt-f2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="autologin-on-gdm">
<h2>Autologin on GDM</h2>
<p>I like to suppose that this bug is only on my pc, because I've tried to
configure my autologin user and never ever is autologued. Perhaps I
should submit a bug for this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="difficulty-to-install-extensions">
<h2>Difficulty to install extensions</h2>
<p>I will not say anything more about this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-autohide-bar-and-no-more-bars">
<h2>No autohide bar, and no more bars?</h2>
<p>I know that gnome-shell isn't thinked to do that, but perhaps they must
give a chance to do that to the users that like it.</p>
<p>And finally, one thing that happens with gnome-shell, gnome-do, meego
desktop... Why if you have hide files they appear on recent documents or
in the shell when you start to type? Of course... this hide files isn't
for p0rn, they are my personal documents only.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Few days ago, actually, more than one week ago (but I was very busy :) we made
our first <a class="reference external" href="http://paylogic.github.com/winter-hackathon/">PyGrunn hackathon</a>. I was lucky and from all the list of ideas, the
selected was one of mines! The slides generator, that finally we call
<strong>hovercraft</strong>. Here is a small introduction about what I wanted:</p>
<p><em>A small platform to create slides and have them always associated to a web
with this possibilities:</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Create an account with Google (or perhaps twitter, facebook...), but Google
seems the best option for me now.</em></li>
<li><em>Create or edit new slides related with this account. This slides
creator/editor will have the following functionalities:</em><ul>
<li><em>Select one image for background in fullscreen.</em></li>
<li><em>Write one or 2 lines of text that will always fulfill the width of the
slide.</em></li>
<li><em>Change the font family.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Have a permanent link to your slide (completely public for now).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After the hackathon we got something very similar to what I wanted, with some
small issues. But this post is not about what we did wrong! This post is about
which technologies did we use to finish the project and perhaps, if I am lucky,
start a discussion on why we did/didn't make a good choice.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-do-we-achieve-this">
<h2>How do we achieve this?</h2>
<div class="section" id="backend">
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>The backend of the application was almost inexistent, we only wanted to allow
the users to login with a Google account to have access to edit their slides.
Being a hackathon we didn't spend time adding <abbr title="Create/Read/Update/Delete">CRUD</abbr> functionalities to manage the users.</p>
<p>If you want to delete your user, let me know, I will do it by hand :) It was
made with <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, Flask-OAuth for the authentication with Google and <a class="reference external" href="http://redis.io/">redis</a>
to store the presentations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frontend">
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>The viewer was really simply too because from the beginning we wanted to play
with the editor (it was more funny). For doing it we used <a class="reference external" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">revealjs</a> to show
the presentation with slide effect and <a class="reference external" href="http://fittextjs.com/">jquery-fittext</a> to make it fullslide.</p>
<p>Now the important part! We made the editor with <a class="reference external" href="http://agonzalezro.github.com/backbonejs-underscore-small-intro.html">backbone and underscore</a>, it
seems to us the better choice, since we will have 3 principal views:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The background chooser</dt>
<dd>which is connection to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantart</a> to perform a
query of good backgrounds for your slide. Then you can click on one of the
results and will be applied to the current slide.</dd>
<dt>The font chooser</dt>
<dd>which is loading some google fonts, we wanted to do this
automagically but we couldn't finish it at time. The behaviour is the same,
you choose a font and its applied to the current slide.</dd>
<dt>The slide content</dt>
<dd>that should be <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>
but for now is on the middle, because we couldn't make the text bigger while
you are writing.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deployment">
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>And finally the deployment that was made with <cite>heroku</cite> and <cite>redistogo</cite> that
allows you to use a 5M non-persistant DB that is good for a demo.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resources">
<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can see <cite>the list of all the projects</cite> or...</li>
<li>You can find all the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/agonzalezro/hovercraft">source on github</a> or...</li>
<li>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://nameless-spire-1402.herokuapp.com/">try a demo</a> too!</li>
<li>And if you are too lazy to try it, here you have an screenshot:</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="thanks">
<h2>Thanks!</h2>
<p>I really want to thank <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paylogic.nl">Paylogic</a> for letting us a place where to do the project
and for provide us food &amp; beers. What a developer will develop without food and
beer?</p>
<p>I want to thank too all the guys that &quot;spend&quot; the weekend with me having fun, but working hard too!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The good point of all this editing is that thanks to backbone and thanks to the
backend guys is saved without any action needed. The idea of this full project
was:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Have fun!</strong></li>
<li>Simplifying slide creation</li>
<li>Make it really simply to share those slides.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't want to go really depth into the development of this project, <strong>I only wanted to give a quick overview of what we made in two days.</strong> But if you are really interested on something more explained, let me know on the comments and I will try to help you in all what I can.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This are some notes that I took while the talk that I saw today, the original
title of the talk that I had the chance to see today was: &quot;Switch to Python
3... Now... Inmediately&quot; by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.russel.org.uk">professor Russel Winder</a>.</p>
<p>More or less all that you will find here is a transaction, just ordered in my
style and perhaps with some notes by myself.</p>
<p>Python 2.x remains being the default python. Too many people and organizations
are afraid of the change.</p>
<p>Python software foundation should declare python 3 the default python
immediately.</p>
<div class="section" id="problems">
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>some big companies are telling people to don't use it.</li>
<li>some crucial projects are not using Python 3 yet.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="companies-and-people">
<h3>Companies and people</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>from the point of view of Russel, the problem are those companies that
doesn't want to migrate, and not the fact that the code needs to be migrate.</li>
<li>at least they should have version 2 and 3 compatible on the codebase.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration">
<h3>Migration</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">2to3</tt> tool is not useful at all. Just one shot transform tool.</li>
<li>the manual the better? From my POV (Álex) you can never let a machine this
kind of work and it usually will be a biblical proportion job for large
codebases. And more important... usually without tests :D</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="justifications">
<h2>Justifications</h2>
<p>Python 2 is a dead end and python 3 is the developing future.</p>
<p>This piece of code is compatible with both versions, why don't use them?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Problem: <tt class="docutils literal">print(x)</tt> support multiple parameter in python 3, so, let's import
the function from future to have the same behaviour in python 2.x:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">print_function</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's make it bigger:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">division</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">absolute_import</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">print_function</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">unicode_literals</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With this we will avoid problems with floats on divisions, add <cite>.</cite> to the
imports, import the python3 version of print and work always with unicode.</p>
<p>Another problem is the list-comprehensions which will change a little bit,
instead create list, they will create sets.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-other-problems">
<h3>Some other problems</h3>
<p>python 2 is strict, but python 3 is kinda lazy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Will produce an iterator in python 3, in python 2 is a data structure.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest issues into the migration, other functions with same
problems will be, for example: <tt class="docutils literal">items</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">keys</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">values</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">iteritems</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">iterkeys</tt> &amp; <tt class="docutils literal">itervalues</tt> which in python 3 will become: <tt class="docutils literal">items</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">keys</tt> &amp; <tt class="docutils literal">values</tt>.</p>
<p>If you want a data structure instead a iterator, you should make it manually:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># python 2.x</span>
<span class="nb">tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># python 3</span>
</pre></div>
