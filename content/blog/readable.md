Changes on the blog
===================

One of the problems that I always have when I start trying to blog
something is that I get bored very quick of writing and I focus in other
things like CMS, CSS or this kind of things that really doesn't matter
if you have good content.

Today was one of those day when I got bored about it and I decided to
make some changes:

-   The theme is [readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable) instead
    [journal](http://bootswatch.com/journal).
-   I've added a [twitter](http://twitter.com/agonzalezro) widget
    because I post half of my life there :D
-   I don't post so often, so I decided that the pagination was not
    really needed and instead that I am showing a column with 16 old
    post. If you look for a tag you will find this column too, but just
    for the post on that tag.

I hope that you enjoy the changes, and if you are a master of the
design, please, help me! :D You can find all the [source code of the
blog here](http://github.com/agonzalezro/agonzalezro.github.com)!
