Here at [Shopa](http://shopa.com) we use Go for some services but we use a lot
of Rails as well so not everybody needs to know Go. This is why I've decided to
do a small introduction to it in one of our workshops.

The slides are mainly examples with a little bit of history around the Go
world. If you find them useful, feel free to grab them here:

Probably I've forgotten about something but it was just a 1 hour and a half presentation.

[Here you can see them in
action](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/agonzalezro/slides/go/101.slide).
I didn't iframed them here because the layout was ugly and the sliding between
slides kinda poor.
