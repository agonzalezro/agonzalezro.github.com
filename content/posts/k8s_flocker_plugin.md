Last month I was working with the guys from [Jetstack](http://www.jetstack.io/) & [ClusterHQ](https://clusterhq.com/) developing a plugina for Kubernetes that will allow the people to easily use [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/flocker/introduction/) there.

Yesterday I had the pleasure of sharing the stage with [Rimas Mocevicius](https://twitter.com/Rimusz), [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) & [Ivan Pedrazas](https://twitter.com/ipedrazas) at the [Kubernetes London meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-London/events/226026848/) to present the plugin and show the audience that creating volume plugins for Kubernetes is easier than it looks at the first glance.

As an introduction of what you will find:

1. Introduction to Flocker
2. Introduction to Kubernetes
3. Introduction to the plugin itself
4. Code
5. Summary

Here they are:

Also, if you want to take a look to the presenter notes or the original slides, I have them in a GitHub repo: https://github.com/agonzalezro/slides/tree/master/k8s_flocker_plugin
