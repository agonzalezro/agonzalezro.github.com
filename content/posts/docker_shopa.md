Today I gave a workshop at Shopa about Docker: what is it, why it's useful for
us and why it can even be more useful.

I understand that just the slides without any context can be a little bit
misleading, but in case that it helps somebody I will share them here:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="89a4c425784846e38d93e6328dbfecef" data-ratio="1.36898395721925" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

The design of the PDF looks uglier than it really is, so if you want the html
slides you can always use the [`Dockerfile` provided with the source of the
slides](https://github.com/agonzalezro/slides/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) :)
