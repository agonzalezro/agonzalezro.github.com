Hi mum & dad (my 2 followers on the blog?) some friends,

[Sam](https://twitter.com/_samdb) & [David](https://twitter.com/_samdb)) and
myself have decided to organize a Go conference in the UK the next August 21.

He had opened the blind bird at the beginning of the week and we are already
close to finish those cheap tickets, so hurry up and [buy a
ticket](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/golang-uk-conference-2015-tickets-16233380478).
We can see for the call for papers already received that the quality of the
talks is going to be awesome, but don't miss your opportunity as [send us a
paper](http://www.golanguk.com/speakers/) before May 31st.

As a final note I want to and that if you want to sponsor the event or you have
any further question, feel free to presonally [contact
me](https://twitter.com/agonzalezro) or do it through the conference email:

I know that a bunch of assiduous people to the meetups is going already, so
hope to see you there as well!
