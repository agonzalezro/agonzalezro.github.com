I am really proud of say that the next month I will be giving a talk at
PyGrunn!

This is a really good new for me because PyGrunn is the conference that
my old colleagues organize since years ago. I was on it first time in
2011 just one week after I started working at
[Paylogic](http://paylogic.com). I meet a lot of interesting people
there and I will see them again this year!

In 2012 I repeat, but at that time I had already started to organize the
"Monthly PyGrunn"s with [Ivor](http://twitter.com/_ivor). TBH that talks
were quite successful, and not for the quantity of people that we get
there, if not for the quality of them and the networking after!

I am really happy too because going there I will be able to see a lot of
friends that I miss! I just moved here 5 months ago but I really want to
see them!

Now, the less important thing: about the talk! I will be talking about
Thrift and how can we use it to talk between different applications in
different languages (in the examples: Python & Scala). When PyGrunn
finish I think that I will have a video where you can see the talk (or
check my English) and I will upload the slides too!

Thanks to [PyGrunn](http://www.pygrunn.org) for give me this chance!
