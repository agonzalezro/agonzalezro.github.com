Python and Scala smoke the peace pipe
=====================================

This was my talk on the [PyGrunn](http://pygrunn.nl) conference last
Friday.

I was explaining how can you communicate services written in different
languages using [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) for that.

In few days the videos will be available, but TBH, I don't really know
if I will publish it here. It was not the first time that I talk in
public using English, but it will be the first time that it is
recorded... I don't really know if I want to see that! :D

I really need to improve my speed talking for the next time. I thought
that I will not have enough time to explain all, so, my subconscious
decided that I should be talking as a machine gun.

Below, you will find the slides, if not, [try this
