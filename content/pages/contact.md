Do you really want to do it? Ok, you have several ways:

- All the things that I try to explain in 140 characters, AKA my [Twitter
  profile](http://twitter.com/agonzalezro).
- If you want to see me partying (yes, developers do that too) you can check
  my [Facebook profile](http://facebook.com/alexandre.gonzalez), but are you
  my real-life friend?
- If you are interested in a more professional way, check my [LinkedIn
  profile](http://linkedin.com/in/alexandregonzalezrodriguez).
- Of course, all the stuff that I do with code can be found at my [GitHub
  account](http://github.com/agonzalezro).
- And if you are not bored after all this, please, take a look to my
  [CV](https://github.com/agonzalezro/Curriculum-Vitae/blob/master/cv_alex_gonzalez.pdf?raw=true).
- You could also send me an email, but I will let the exercise of finding the
  address to you.
