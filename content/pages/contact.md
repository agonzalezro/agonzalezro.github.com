You have several ways:

- [My Twitter profile](http://twitter.com/agonzalezro).
- [My LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/alexandregonzalezrodriguez).
- [GitHub account](http://github.com/agonzalezro).
- [My CV](https://github.com/agonzalezro/Curriculum-Vitae/blob/master/cv_alex_gonzalez.pdf?raw=true).
- You could also send me an email, but I will let the exercise of finding the address to you.

From all the above, I would recommend you to use Twitter, I am almost always there and I tend to be quicker replying. Said so, don't try to sell me "anything" on Twitter, neither by mail, I will not buy it.
