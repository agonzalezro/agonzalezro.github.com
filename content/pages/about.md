Hi there! My name is Álex. I am an IT guy with passion on development and nowadays in infrastructure as well since Docker, Kubernetes and others happened.

On my day to day job I work as software architect for [jobandtalent.com](https://jobandtalent.com). I came to work here (Madrid) in October 2015 after expending some years in London (UK) and in Groningen (NL).

While I was in London I worked in [Shopa](http://shopa.com) & [GreenManGaming](http://greenmangaming.com) but you can find more info about that on my [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/alexandregonzalezrodriguez). Before moving to Madrid I was working as contractor with [Jetstack](http://www.jetstack.io/) doing [this PR for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/14328), it's the [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/flocker/introduction/) plugin for k8s.

As you have probably deducted my background is mainly technical, but I got interested by business at the beginning of my career so I started my own company in Spain which was a completely economic disaster but I learned a lot & I studied a MSc in Electronic Commerce too hoping that it would be handy in the future.

As a FLOSS passionate I think that sharing is caring, this is why I try to share things that I think can be interesting for the community. Also, being selfish, writing the blog helps me a lot in two things: keeping up to my English & organise my ideas in a meaningful format.
