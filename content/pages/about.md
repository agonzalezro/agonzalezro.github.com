Hi there! My name is √Ålex. I am an IT guy with passion on development and nowadays in infrastructure as well since Docker, Kubernetes and others happened.

On my day to day job I work as team lead at [BBVA](https://www.bbva.es), a big spanish bank with presence in several countries, where we are trying to create a PAAS that other employees can use to deploy their beautiful applications.
I work remotely from Mil√°n so if you want to buy me an Spritz I am up to it ü§£.

Before Mil√°n, I have been living in Madrid where I moved to work as software architect for [jobandtalent.com](https://jobandtalent.com).
I moved to Madrid in October 2015 after expending some years in London (UK) and in Groningen (NL).

While I was in London I worked in [Shopa](http://shopa.com) & [GreenManGaming](http://greenmangaming.com) but you can find more info about that on my [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/alexandregonzalezrodriguez). Before moving to Madrid I was working as contractor with [Jetstack](http://www.jetstack.io/) doing [this PR for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/14328), it's the [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/flocker/introduction/) plugin for k8s.

As you have probably deducted my background is mainly technical, but I got interested by business at the beginning of my career so I started my own company in Spain which was a completely economic disaster but I learned a lot & I studied a MSc in Electronic Commerce too hoping that it would be handy in the future. TL;DR; I don't think it was (yet).

As a FLOSS passionate I think that sharing is caring, this is why I try to share things that I think can be interesting for the community. I try to write in this blog from time to time mainly for two reasons: keep improving my English & organise my ideas in a meaningful format.

Do you like the blog? You can find the source code of this blog (generated with [polo](https://github.com/agonzalezro/polo)) at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/agonzalezro).

As a final note, I am addicted to twitter so if you want to reach me, one of the easiest ways is to ping me there at [@agonzalezro](https://twitter.com/agonzalezro). I also provided [some other ways to contact](/pages/contact.html).
