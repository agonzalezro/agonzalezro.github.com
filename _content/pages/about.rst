Hello!

My name is Alexandre Gonz√°lez, I am |age| years old Spanish developer currently working at Holland, exactly at Groningen in Paylogic_.

My background is mainly technical, I've studied Computer Science at Spain, but in some time of my life I was interested in business too, so I created my own company which was a complete economic disaster, but, I learn a lot! At that time I studied a Master in Electronic Commerce too beacuse I thought that it could be usefull. You should know too that I am really passionate about :abbr:`FLOSS (Free as Libre Open Source Software)`.

The main reason of write this blog is improve my poor English and talk about the things that I really love, that usually are related with the technology and specially with Python. BTW, you can find the source code of this blog (generated with Pelican_) at my `github profile`_ or clicking on the right upper corner link.
