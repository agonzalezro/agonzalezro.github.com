Changes on the blog
===================

:date: 2013-3-20 00:48
:tags: theme, readable, layout

One of the problems that I always have when I start trying to blog something is
that I get bored very quick of writing and I focus in other things like CMS,
CSS or this kind of things that really doesn't matter if you have good content.

Today was one of those day when I got bored about it and I decided to make some
changes:

- The theme is `readable`_ instead `journal`_.
- I've added a `twitter`_ widget because I post half of my life there :D
- I don't post so often, so I decided that the pagination was not
  really needed and instead that I am showing a column with 16 old
  post. If you look for a tag you will find this column too, but just
  for the post on that tag.

I hope that you enjoy the changes, and if you are a master of the design,
please, help me! :D You can find all the `source code of the blog here
