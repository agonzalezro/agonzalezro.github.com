Python and Scala smoke the peace pipe

This was my talk on the `PyGrunn`_ conference last Friday.

I was explaining how can you communicate services written in different
languages using `Apache Thrift`_ for that.

In few days the videos will be available, but TBH, I don't really know if I
will publish it here. It was not the first time that I talk in public using
English, but it will be the first time that it is recorded... I don't really
know if I want to see that! :D

I really need to improve my speed talking for the next time. I thought that I
will not have enough time to explain all, so, my subconscious decided that I
should be talking as a machine gun.
